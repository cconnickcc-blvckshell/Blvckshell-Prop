# Efficiency & Trust Principle

**Core rule:** You do not add efficiency features to be competitive. You add them **only when they reinforce your trust spine instead of replacing it**.

Most companies add efficiency first, bolt on proof later, and lose trust under pressure. You built the order correctly. Don’t reverse it.

## The Right Question for Every Feature

Before adding any “efficiency” feature, ask:

> **Does this reduce human friction *without reducing auditability*?**

- **Yes** → candidate  
- **No / unclear** → reject or defer  

Efficiency that weakens proof is not efficiency. It’s deferred failure.

## Three Categories of Efficiency Features

### CATEGORY A — SAFE & INEVITABLE (add these)

These **strengthen** the system without changing its nature.

1. **Bulk & assisted admin actions**  
   Approve multiple jobs at once (with per-job audit entries), generate invoices for a period, batch-create recurring jobs.  
   **Rule:** Bulk ≠ blind. Every action still logs.

2. **Reuse & templating**  
   Job templates, checklist templates, contract templates, site defaults. Reduces setup time and human error. You already do this conceptually; formalizing it is natural.

3. **Light automation with explicit states**  
   Auto-generate invoices *after* approval, auto-create make-good jobs *after* missed jobs, auto-reminders for pending approvals.  
   **Constraint:** Automation must **trigger states**, not skip them.

---

### CATEGORY B — CONDITIONAL (add later, with guardrails)

4. **Route optimization / smart scheduling**  
   Delay until stable demand. Only if it respects contracts, service windows, and audit rules. Prefer suggestion, not enforcer.

5. **Supervisor mobile dashboards**  
   If added: supervisor actions must be logged, overrides must require reasons, visibility must not replace evidence.

---

### CATEGORY C — DO NOT ADD (unless strategy changes)

6. **Time-clock-centric workflows**  
   Shifts focus from outcomes → presence; encourages “checked in = worked.” Your system correctly centers **completion + evidence**, not time. Avoid unless legally required, and keep it secondary.

7. **“One-click complete” shortcuts**  
   Anything that allows skipping evidence, bypassing checklists, or auto-completing jobs will cost credibility. Do not add.

---

## Mental Model

Efficiency = **reducing cognitive load without reducing accountability**.

Not: speed at all costs, fewer clicks at all costs, or “what competitors have.”

Buyers are paying to **not worry**, not for speed.

---

## Concrete Guidance

**Now (0–6 months)**  
Add: bulk admin actions, templates everywhere, small automations that trigger states, notification hygiene.  
Do **not** add: route optimization, heavy scheduling AI, supervisor override tools, time-clock-first UX.

**Later (after real usage)**  
Evaluate: which steps cause fatigue without adding safety, where admins repeat identical actions, where humans are error-prone. Then automate **those** — surgically.

---

## Most Important Warning

Do **not** say: *“Other cleaning software has X, so we should too.”*

Do say: *“Does adding X make our trust promise stronger or weaker?”*

If weaker — don’t add it, even if it’s popular.

---

## Plain Answer

- **Yes** — you will add some efficiency features.  
- **No** — you should not mirror specialized cleaning software.  
- **Yes** — efficiency must serve auditability, not replace it.  
- **No** — you are not missing anything critical *right now*.
