You are Cursor acting as a senior full-stack engineer. Build a SUBCONTRACTOR PORTAL MVP for BLVCKSHELL Facilities Services.

GOAL
A subcontractor-only portal that answers:
1) Where do I go?
2) When do I go?
3) What exactly do I do there?
4) How do I prove completion so I get paid?

HARD SCOPE LIMITS (DO NOT DRIFT)
- ONLY subcontractor portal + minimal admin approval. NO client portal.
- NO automated payments, NO reporting dashboards, NO SLA timers, NO multi-org complexity.
- NO KPI dashboards or metrics visualization in Phase 1. Data is collected for audit/compliance but NOT visualized.
- Keep it simple, production-safe, deterministic, and auditable.

TECH STACK (use exactly this unless already present)
- Next.js 14+ App Router (TypeScript)
- Postgres
- Prisma ORM
- Auth: NextAuth (Credentials provider) OR custom JWT if simpler, but must be secure.
- File storage: local dev file system for MVP + interface layer so we can swap to S3 later.
- Styling: Tailwind (clean, minimal, professional). No fancy UI libraries.

MULTI-TENANCY
- Single company (BLVCKSHELL) for MVP.
- Users have roles: ADMIN or SUBCONTRACTOR.
- SUBCONTRACTOR sees only their assigned jobs.
- ADMIN can manage sites, scopes/checklists, assign jobs, approve completion, mark payouts.

CORE ENTITIES (Prisma models)
Create Prisma models (with proper relations, indexes) for:
- User (id, email, passwordHash, role, name, phone, isActive, createdAt)
- Site (id, name, addressLine1, city, province, postalCode, accessInstructions, notes, isActive)
- ChecklistTemplate (id, siteId, title, items[], isActive, version, createdAt)  // items stored as JSON array with stable itemIds
- Job (id, siteId, assignedToUserId, scheduledStart, scheduledEnd, status, payoutAmountCents, createdAt)
- JobCompletion (id, jobId, completedByUserId, completedAt, checklistResults JSON, notes)
- Evidence (id, jobCompletionId, filePath, fileType, uploadedAt)
- Approval (id, jobId, approvedByUserId, approvedAt, decision, notes)
- PayoutBatch (id, periodStart, periodEnd, status, createdAt)
- PayoutLine (id, payoutBatchId, userId, jobId, amountCents, status)

STATE MACHINES (ENFORCE THESE IN CODE)
Job.status enum:
- SCHEDULED
- COMPLETED_PENDING_APPROVAL
- APPROVED_PAYABLE
- PAID
- CANCELLED

Rules:
- Only SUBCONTRACTOR can move SCHEDULED -> COMPLETED_PENDING_APPROVAL by submitting completion.
- Completion submission requires: all checklist items answered + minimum photo evidence count (configurable per site, default 4).
- Only ADMIN can approve: COMPLETED_PENDING_APPROVAL -> APPROVED_PAYABLE.
- Only ADMIN can mark paid: APPROVED_PAYABLE -> PAID (via payout batch).
- Every state transition must be written to an AuditLog table (add this model) with: actorUserId, entityType, entityId, fromState, toState, metadata JSON, createdAt.

PAGES / UX (App Router)
Subcontractor pages:
- /login
- /jobs (list upcoming + past, with status chips)
- /jobs/[id] (job detail: site info, access instructions, checklist, evidence uploader, submit completion)
- /earnings (list jobs and payout status; show totals for current period)

Admin pages (simple, not pretty, but usable):
- /admin/sites (CRUD)
- /admin/sites/[id]/checklists (manage checklist template versions + required photo count per site)
- /admin/jobs (create jobs, assign to subcontractors, calendar-lite list view)
- /admin/jobs/[id] (review completion, photos, approve/reject with notes)
- /admin/payouts (create payout batch for a date range; include approved jobs; mark paid)

CHECKLIST & EVIDENCE
- Each Site has a requiredPhotoCount integer.
- Checklist items must be stable (each item has itemId + label).
- Completion stores results as JSON keyed by itemId with values: PASS/FAIL/NA + optional note.
- Evidence uploader must support multiple images, store them, and associate them to completion.
- Show thumbnails in review.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
- RBAC enforced server-side on every route/action.
- Prevent IDOR: a subcontractor must never access another subcontractor’s job.
- CSRF protection if using NextAuth.
- Validate all inputs with zod.
- Use server actions or API routes with strict validation; no direct client DB access.

DATA SEEDING
- Provide a seed script that creates:
  - 1 admin user
  - 2 subcontractor users
  - 2 sites with checklists
  - 6 jobs assigned across subs

DELIVERABLES
1) Working app with the routes above
2) Prisma schema + migrations
3) Seed script + README with setup steps
4) Clean code, no placeholders, no TODOs for core flows
5) Unit tests for state transitions + RBAC checks (minimal but real)

BUILD ORDER
1) Setup Next.js + Tailwind + Prisma + Auth
2) Prisma models + migrations + seed
3) Subcontractor job list/detail + completion submission (checklist + photos)
4) Admin review + approve/reject
5) Payout batch + mark paid
6) Audit log + tests

IMPORTANT
- Do not add features outside scope.
- If any requirement is ambiguous, make the simplest reasonable choice and document it in README.
- Keep UI clean and professional (BLVCKSHELL vibe: dark/neutral, but do not overdesign).

prompt 1 (REVISED) — Workforce Operations Portal (MODIFY & FINALIZE)
Use this spec to modify and finalize the existing Subcontractor Portal. This supersedes the original Prompt 1 for implementation. Not greenfield; required adjustments and expansions only. No UX redesign unless required.

You are Cursor acting as a PRINCIPAL FULL-STACK ENGINEER and OPERATIONS ARCHITECT. MODIFY AND FINALIZE the existing Subcontractor Portal MVP for BLVCKSHELL Facilities Services so it is production-safe, scalable, and operationally correct.

CORE GOAL
Build a WORKFORCE-DRIVEN OPERATIONS PORTAL that supports:
• Vendor subcontractors with MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES (teams)
• Internal BLVCKSHELL employees
• Admin-controlled job assignment, approval, and payout
• Deterministic state machines
• Audit-safe evidence collection
• Compliance enforcement
• Supabase + Prisma + Vercel correctness

System must survive audits, disputes, staff turnover, and growth.

TECH STACK (LOCKED)
• Next.js 14+ App Router (TypeScript)
• Prisma ORM
• Supabase Postgres
• Supabase Storage (MANDATORY — no local filesystem)
• Vercel deployment
• Auth: NextAuth Credentials OR custom JWT (bcrypt required)
• Tailwind CSS (clean, minimal)

DATABASE CONNECTION RULES:
• Use Supabase pooled DATABASE_URL for runtime
• Use DIRECT_URL for Prisma migrations
• Document this clearly in README

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS
• NO client portal
• NO automated payments
• NO reporting dashboards or KPI visualization (Phase 1)
• NO scope creep
• NO hourly billing logic
• NO filesystem storage
• NO soft state transitions
• ALL permissions enforced server-side
• ALL state transitions audit logged
• EVERYTHING deterministic
• Metrics collected but NOT visualized: missed visits, recleans, time-to-approval, vendor incident rate (see ROADMAP.md Part 8)

If ambiguous, choose the SIMPLEST defensible option and document in DECISIONS.md.

REQUIRED CORE MODELS (PRISMA)

1) ClientOrganization (minimal, future-proof)
- id, name, primaryContactName, primaryContactEmail, primaryContactPhone, notes, createdAt

2) WorkforceAccount
- type enum: INTERNAL | VENDOR
- id, type, displayName, legalName (nullable), primaryContactName, primaryContactEmail, primaryContactPhone, hstNumber (nullable), wsibAccountNumber (nullable), isActive, createdAt, updatedAt

4) Worker (operational identity)
- id, userId (unique), workforceAccountId, hasPhotoIdOnFile (bool), isActive, createdAt, updatedAt

5) ComplianceDocument (Supabase Storage)
- type enum: COI | WSIB | AGREEMENT | HST | OTHER
- id, workforceAccountId, type, storagePath, expiresAt (nullable), uploadedAt
- RULE: Expired or missing COI/WSIB blocks new job assignment unless ADMIN override (audit logged).

6) Site

- id, siteId, scheduledStart, scheduledEnd, status, payoutAmountCents, assignedWorkforceAccountId (nullable), assignedWorkerId (nullable), isMissed (bool), missedReason (nullable), makeGoodJobId (nullable), createdAt
- RULE: Exactly ONE of assignedWorkforceAccountId OR assignedWorkerId must be set.

10) JobCompletion
- id, jobId (unique, 1:1), completedByWorkerId, completedAt, checklistResults JSON, notes

11) Evidence (Supabase Storage)
- id, jobCompletionId, storagePath, fileType, uploadedAt

12) WorkOrder (change order / add-on)

- Payouts go to WorkforceAccount. Worker reference optional for reporting.

15) AuditLog (MANDATORY)
- id, actorUserId, actorWorkerId (nullable), actorWorkforceAccountId (nullable), entityType, entityId, fromState, toState, metadata JSON, createdAt

STATE MACHINES (ENFORCE IN CODE)

Job:
• SCHEDULED → COMPLETED_PENDING_APPROVAL (Worker only; checklist + photos required)
• COMPLETED_PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED_PAYABLE (ADMIN only)
• COMPLETED_PENDING_APPROVAL → SCHEDULED (ADMIN reject; rejection reason required)
• SCHEDULED or COMPLETED_PENDING_APPROVAL → CANCELLED (ADMIN only)
• APPROVED_PAYABLE → PAID (ADMIN only via payout batch)
Missed visit: mark job isMissed=true; create make-good Job linked via makeGoodJobId.
NO other Job transitions allowed. ALL transitions write AuditLog.

RBAC (NON-NEGOTIABLE, SERVER-SIDE)
ADMIN: Full access; workforce + worker management; compliance enforcement; job assignment/reassignment; approvals; payouts; overrides.
VENDOR_OWNER: Manage workers in own WorkforceAccount; view vendor-assigned jobs; NO pricing visibility; NO approvals; NO payouts.
VENDOR_WORKER / INTERNAL_WORKER: View only assigned jobs; submit completion proof; view earnings (read-only).

REQUIRED SCREENS

ADMIN: /admin/workforce, /admin/workforce/[id], /admin/jobs, /admin/jobs/[id], /admin/workorders, /admin/incidents, /admin/payouts
WORKERS: /jobs, /jobs/[id], /earnings, /profile
VENDOR OWNER (scaffold): /vendor/team, /vendor/jobs

FILE UPLOAD (SUPABASE STORAGE)
• jpg, jpeg, png, webp only; max 10MB
• Path: evidence/{jobId}/{completionId}/{timestamp}-{uuid}.{ext}
• Server-side validation; reject completion if photo minimum not met
• Retention: 90 days default (manual purge OK); document in DATA_RETENTION.md

REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION
• README.md (setup + deploy; DATABASE_URL vs DIRECT_URL)
• DECISIONS.md (explicit product decisions)
• SECURITY.md (RBAC + data handling)
• DATA_RETENTION.md
• SEED.md (seed instructions)

SEED DATA (MUST INCLUDE)
• 1 admin
• 1 vendor workforce with 2 workers
• 1 internal workforce with 1 worker
• 2 client orgs
• 2 sites
• 6 jobs (mixed assignments)
• 1 missed visit + make-good job
• 1 work order
• 1 incident

PRODUCTION READINESS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Implement these so the portal survives real ops and security scrutiny. Do not ship without them.

Security hardening
• Rate limit: login, job completion submission, and evidence upload endpoints (per-IP or per-user); document in SECURITY.md.
• Session: timeout and refresh strategy (e.g. 24h max, refresh on activity); document in SECURITY.md.
• Login backoff / lockout: after N failed attempts (e.g. 5), temporary backoff or lockout; document in SECURITY.md.
• Password reset: no self-serve in MVP; admin can reset user password (audit logged). See DECISIONS.md.

Data integrity
• Deletion: prefer RESTRICT on FKs for Job, JobCompletion, Evidence, AuditLog; soft-deactivate (isActive = false) for User, WorkforceAccount, Site; document cascade/restrict in schema and DECISIONS.md.
• Uniques: User.email; JobCompletion.jobId (1:1 with Job); one active ChecklistTemplate per site per version (document and enforce).
• completedByWorkerId: allowed when job is assigned to WorkforceAccount (any worker from that account may complete); document in DECISIONS.md.

UX reliability (operational failure handling)
• Upload retry + draft: allow retry on failed uploads; support saving partial completion (draft) so worker can resume without losing work.
• Validation errors: clear inline errors for missing required photos, missing checklist items, wrong file type/size before submit.
• Mobile-first completion: job completion flow must work on mobile; camera upload for evidence; touch-friendly checklist and submit.

Decision locks (must be in DECISIONS.md)
• Evidence retention window (e.g. 90 days) and purge process.
• Compliance gating: expired/missing COI/WSIB blocks new assignment; ADMIN override only with audit log (metadata: reason, overrideAt).
• Access credential masking: codes masked in UI (e.g. last 4); full value only to authorized roles; document in SECURITY.md.
• Max photos per job: cap (e.g. 20); enforce in UI (disable past cap) and server (reject upload and completion over cap).
• Vendor owner job reassignment: Phase 1 = No; only ADMIN assigns/reassigns jobs.
• Final implementation locks (DECISIONS.md): Supabase Storage security (server-only service role vs signed URLs—choose one); draft completion model (JobCompletionDraft table OR JobCompletion DRAFT status; define if photos attach to drafts); workforce-assigned job visibility (Phase 1: job shown to workers only when assignedWorkerId set by admin—do not show to whole team until claimed/assigned); max photo cap enforced UI + server; password reset = admin-initiated only, audit logged.

Testing bar (explicit suite)
• Unit: all allowed and denied state transitions per role (Job and WorkOrder); explicit cases, not "minimal."
• RBAC/IDOR: attempts to access another user's job, completion, evidence, work order, incident must return 403; cover all five.
• Storage/upload: reject disallowed MIME and oversize; assert no file stored.
• One E2E: assign → complete (checklist + photos) → approve → payout batch → mark paid.

IMPORTANT
• No TODOs in core logic
• No fake flows
• No redesign unless required
• Prefer auditability > correctness > simplicity > speed
• Build boring, defensible software
• Do not treat as production-ready until all PRODUCTION READINESS items above are implemented and documented


prompt 2
You are Cursor acting as a senior product engineer + UX-minded frontend dev. Build the FRONT-FACING MARKETING WEBSITE for BLVCKSHELL Facilities Services.

GOAL
A fast, credible, local-services website that converts property managers into calls/emails.
This is NOT a portal. No logins. No dashboards. No apps. Pure marketing + lead capture.

HARD SCOPE LIMITS (DO NOT DRIFT)
- No client portal features.
- No subcontractor portal features.
- No blog/CMS.
- No complex animations.
- No pricing calculator.
- Only: pages, conversion sections, contact form, and a simple “download proposal” CTA.

TECH STACK
- Next.js 14+ App Router (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Deployed-ready (Vercel compatible)
- Forms: simple POST endpoint (Next.js route handler) that emails submissions via SMTP OR stores to DB (Postgres) as a lead table. Choose the simplest reliable option and document it.

BRAND / STYLE
- Brand: BLVCKSHELL (clean, premium, corporate)
- Tone: calm, confident, accountability-focused (not “cheap cleaning”)
- Visual: dark/neutral, strong typography, lots of whitespace, minimal icons, subtle dividers. No cartoonish graphics.

PRIMARY TARGET AUDIENCE
Property Management Companies in Windsor–Essex / Ontario.
Secondary: condo boards, commercial offices, small portfolios.

PRIMARY POSITIONING (copy must reflect this)
“We reduce common-area complaints and simplify vendor management through consistent cleaning, clear scope, and fast issue resolution.”

PAGES (App Router)
1) / (Home)
2) /services

- “What to expect” + “Request a site walk”

Commercial landing page (/commercial-cleaning):
- Professional appearance, after-hours, minimal disruption
- Office scope: washrooms, kitchens, floors, glass, trash
- Optional day porter / extra visits

Light maintenance page (/light-maintenance):
- Clearly define “light, non-licensed, common-area maintenance”
- Provide “we will do” list and “we will not do” list (no electrical/plumbing/HVAC/fire/elevators)
- Offer as optional add-on and/or per-call

About page:

- Display service area + response time expectation (e.g. “We respond within 1 business day”)

LEAD CAPTURE (REQUIRED)
Implement /api/lead endpoint:
- Validates input with zod
- Stores to DB table Lead (id, createdAt, name, company, role, phone, email, propertyType, sitesCount, message, sourcePage)
OR emails via SMTP (choose one). Must work in dev.

SEO / TECH QUALITY (REQUIRED)
- Metadata for each page (title, description)
- OpenGraph tags
- Sitemap + robots.txt
- Performance-focused (next/image, minimal JS)
- Accessibility: proper headings, labels, keyboard nav
- No broken links, no placeholder lorem ipsum

ASSETS / DOWNLOADS
- Add a /downloads page OR a button that serves an existing PDF from /public (e.g. /public/BLVCKSHELL_Condo_Cleaning_Proposal.pdf)
- If the PDF file isn’t present, create a placeholder file name reference and document “drop PDF here” in README (do not generate fake content).

DELIVERABLES
1) Working site with all pages
2) Contact form that actually captures leads (DB or email)
3) Clean, professional copy aligned to property managers
4) README with setup + deploy steps

BUILD ORDER
1) Setup layout, header/footer, global styles
2) Build Home + Contact with working lead capture
3) Build Services + Condo + Commercial + Light Maintenance pages
4) Add About + Privacy
5) Add SEO (metadata, sitemap, robots)

IMPORTANT
- Stay within scope.
- Use clean Tailwind components (no UI libraries).
- Make it feel like a serious facilities vendor, not a startup template.

prompt 3
You are Cursor acting as a principal operations architect and senior technical writer. Your job is to produce a Tier-1 "Operations Binder" for BLVCKSHELL Facilities Services (Ontario, Canada): contracts, SOPs, policies, QA forms, and supporting checklists. This binder must be immediately usable to run condo + rental/common-area cleaning with subcontractors, and must be structured so it can be loaded into a portal later (site templates, checklists, forms, and state workflows).

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS
- Do not invent legal advice; draft "commercially standard" agreements and include a "review by Ontario counsel recommended" note.
- No placeholders like "TBD" for core content. Where details vary by site, use explicit bracket fields (e.g., [SITE NAME], [FREQUENCY], [REQUIRED PHOTO COUNT]).
- No generic fluff. Every section must be actionable: procedures, decision rules, acceptance criteria, and evidence requirements.
- Keep everything deterministic: define "done," "pass/fail," and "who decides."
- Use clear Ontario/Canada terms: HST, WSIB, COI (Certificate of Insurance), etc.

DELIVERABLE FORMAT
Create a folder-style output in Markdown with separate files (show content for each file). Use this exact structure:
