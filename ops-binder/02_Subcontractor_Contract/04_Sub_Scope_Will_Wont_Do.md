## Triage Process

**When maintenance issue discovered:**

1. **Assess issue:**
   - What is broken/damaged?
   - Is it common-area?
   - Is it light maintenance (per "will do" list)?
   - Is licensed trade required?

2. **Decision tree:**
   - **Light maintenance (will do):** Proceed per SOP_06
   - **Licensed trade (won't do):** Escalate to Company admin
   - **Unclear:** Escalate to Company admin

3. **Company admin coordinates:**
   - Verifies it's light maintenance or licensed trade
   - Approves work order (if light maintenance)
   - Coordinates licensed contractor (if licensed trade)
