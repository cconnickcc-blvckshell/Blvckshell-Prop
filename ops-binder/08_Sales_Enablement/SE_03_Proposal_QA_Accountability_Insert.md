## Quality Assurance and Accountability

**BLVCKSHELL Facilities Services is committed to consistent, high-quality cleaning. Our QA accountability system ensures you get the service you pay for.**

## Photo Evidence

**Every job includes photo evidence:**

- **Minimum photos:** [X] photos per visit (configurable per site)
- **Mandatory photo items:** Floor, bins, high-touch surfaces (per area)
- **Photo quality:** Clear, well-lit, shows completion
- **Photo retention:** 90 days (internal evidence)

**Why it matters:** Photo evidence proves work was completed to standard. No guesswork, no disputes.

---

## Completion Checklists

**Every job follows a site-specific checklist:**

- **Checklist items:** [X] items per area (lobby, hallways, stairwells, etc.)
- **Required items:** All items must be completed (PASS / FAIL / NA)
- **Visual standards:** No debris, streaks, smudges, or residue
- **Admin review:** Every completion reviewed before approval

**Why it matters:** Checklists ensure consistency. Every area cleaned the same way, every time.

---

## Quality Inspections

**Regular quality inspections:**

- **Inspection cadence:** Monthly or quarterly (per your preference)
- **Inspection method:** Admin walk-through or photo review
- **Scoring:** 0–100 score per inspection
- **Defect tracking:** Deficiencies documented and corrected

**Why it matters:** Inspections catch issues early. Problems fixed before they become complaints.

---

## Rework and Credits

**If work doesn't meet standard:**

- **Reclean authorized:** At no charge to you
- **Deficiencies corrected:** Same worker or alternative worker
- **Completion verified:** Admin verifies reclean completion
- **Credits issued:** If service not performed or below standard

**Why it matters:** You don't pay for substandard work. We fix it, or you get credit.

## Incident Reporting

**Safety and property issues documented:**

- **Incident types:** Safety hazards, property damage, biohazards, lost keys
- **Reporting:** Workers report incidents immediately
- **Resolution:** Admin coordinates resolution with site contact
- **Documentation:** All incidents documented and tracked

**Why it matters:** Safety and property issues handled promptly. No surprises, no delays.

---

## Communication

**Clear communication boundaries:**

- **Admin-only client contact:** Only admin communicates with you
- **Workers communicate via admin:** No direct worker-to-client contact
- **Response times:** Urgent issues within [X] hours, standard within [X] business days
- **Monthly summaries:** Board-ready monthly summaries available (if requested)

**Why it matters:** Consistent communication. One point of contact, no confusion.

- **Completion rate:** [X]% of scheduled visits completed
- **Approval rate:** [X]% of completions approved (first submission)
- **Rejection rate:** [X]% of completions rejected (requiring rework)
- **Incident rate:** [X] incidents per month (tracked and resolved)

**Why it matters:** We measure what matters. Data-driven improvement, not promises.
