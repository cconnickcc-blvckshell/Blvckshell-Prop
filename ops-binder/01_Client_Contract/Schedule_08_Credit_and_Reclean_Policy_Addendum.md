## Credit Policy

### When Credits Issued

**Credits issued to Client if:**

1. **Service not performed:**
   - Job cancelled by Company (not Client)
   - Job missed (no-show by worker)
   - Service hold applied (Company-initiated)

2. **Service below standard:**
   - Repeated failures not corrected
   - Client complaint validated
   - Quality audit identifies deficiencies

3. **Billing errors:**
   - Incorrect invoice amount
   - Duplicate billing
   - Work not performed but billed

---

### Credit Amount

**Credit calculation:**

- **Full credit:** If service not performed (100% of monthly service fee pro-rated per job)
- **Partial credit:** Pro-rated if partially performed (e.g., 50% if half of areas not cleaned)
- **Per job:** Credit amount per missed/incomplete job

**Example:**
- Monthly service: $1,000 per month
- Frequency: 3x/week (12 jobs per month)
- Job value: $1,000 / 12 = $83.33 per job
- If 1 job missed: Credit = $83.33
- If 2 jobs missed: Credit = $166.66

### Credit Process

**Step 1:** Credit authorized:
- Admin authorizes credit
- Amount determined (per credit policy above)

**Step 2:** Credit applied:
- Applied to next invoice
