## Notes

- **Scheduling:** Deep cleans are scheduled separately from regular maintenance; coordinate with admin
- **Time allocation:** Deep cleans require more time than regular cleaning; plan accordingly
- **Supplies:** May require additional supplies (stripper, polish, deep cleaning chemicals); coordinate with admin
- **Access:** Some areas (storage, exterior windows) may require special access; coordinate with admin
- **Reporting:** Document any maintenance issues discovered during deep clean via incident report

## Integration with Regular Checklists

Deep clean checklist items complement regular checklists (CL_01 through CL_07). Regular checklists cover daily/weekly maintenance; this checklist covers quarterly/semi-annual deep cleaning tasks.

**Example:** Regular lobby cleaning (CL_01) covers daily mopping; deep clean (DCL-001) covers quarterly floor stripping/refinishing.
