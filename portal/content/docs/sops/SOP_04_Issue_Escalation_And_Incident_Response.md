## Incident Response Procedure

### Step 1: Identify and Assess

**Step 1.1:** Recognize incident (matches one of categories above)  
**Step 1.2:** Assess severity:
- **Immediate danger:** STOP WORK, evacuate if needed
- **Safety hazard:** STOP WORK, document, escalate
- **Non-safety:** Document, escalate, continue if safe

**Step 1.3:** Do not attempt to fix:
- Do not repair electrical, plumbing, or structural issues
- Do not clean biohazards unless trained
- Do not handle dangerous situations alone

---

### Step 2: Document Incident

**Step 2.1:** Take photos (if safe):
- Photo of hazard/damage
- Photo of location/area
- Photo of any evidence

**Step 2.2:** Document details:
- **Type:** SAFETY / PROPERTY_DAMAGE / BIOHAZARD / LOST_KEY / OTHER
- **Description:** What you observed
- **Location:** Specific area (e.g., "3rd floor hallway, near elevator")
- **Time:** When discovered
- **Severity:** Immediate danger / Safety hazard / Non-safety

**Step 2.3:** Create incident report via portal:
- Fill all required fields
- Upload photos
- Submit immediately

---

### Step 3: Escalate to Admin

**Step 3.1:** Contact admin immediately:
- Via portal message (preferred)
- Via phone if urgent (per admin instructions)

**Step 3.2:** Provide incident report details:
- Incident type
- Location
- Severity
- Photos (if taken)

**Step 3.3:** Wait for admin response:
- Do not proceed until admin responds (for safety hazards)
- Admin will coordinate with site contact if needed

---

### Step 4: Admin Response

**Admin will:**
- Review incident report
- Contact site contact if needed
- Coordinate resolution (repair, cleanup, replacement)
- Update incident status in portal
- Notify worker when safe to proceed

---

### Step 5: Resume Work (If Safe)

**Step 5.1:** Wait for admin confirmation:
- "Safe to proceed" message
- Or "Do not proceed until [condition] resolved"

**Step 5.2:** If safe to proceed:
- Continue cleaning
- Avoid affected area if instructed
- Complete rest of job

**Step 5.3:** If cannot proceed:
- Leave site safely
- Document in job notes
- Admin will reschedule or coordinate alternative

## Decision Tree: When to Call Admin

### Immediate Call (Safety Hazard)

**Call admin immediately if:**
- Exposed wires
- Gas smell
- Active water leak (flooding risk)
- Structural damage (loose handrails, damaged steps)
- Fire hazard
- Biohazard (blood, needles, bodily fluids)

**Action:** STOP WORK → Call admin → Document incident → Wait for resolution

---

### Urgent Call (Within 1 Hour)

**Call admin urgently if:**
- Property damage (broken fixtures, vandalism)
- Lost key/credential
- Overflow garbage (severe)
- Resident complaint about safety

**Action:** Document incident → Call admin → Continue cleaning if safe → Wait for admin response

---

### Standard Escalation (Within 4 Hours)

**Escalate via portal message if:**
- Minor property damage (cosmetic)
- Maintenance issues (burned bulbs, minor leaks)
- Resident complaints (non-safety)
- Access issues

**Action:** Document incident → Submit via portal → Continue cleaning → Admin follows up

---

## Incident Report Fields

**Required fields:**
- **Type:** SAFETY / PROPERTY_DAMAGE / BIOHAZARD / LOST_KEY / OTHER
- **Site:** Site ID/name
- **Worker:** Worker ID/name
- **Description:** Detailed description of incident
- **Location:** Specific area
- **Photos:** Upload photos if safe to take
- **Reported At:** Timestamp (auto-filled)
