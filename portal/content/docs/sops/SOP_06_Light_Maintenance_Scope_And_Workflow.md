# SOP_06: Light Maintenance Scope and Workflow

**SOP Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Purpose:** Define "light, non-licensed, common-area maintenance" scope and workflow. Ensures clear boundaries and proper triage.

---

## Light Maintenance Definition

**Light maintenance** means:
- **Non-licensed work** (no electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire, elevator licenses required)
- **Common-area only** (not inside resident units)
- **Simple repairs** (minor fixes, replacements, adjustments)
- **Preventive maintenance** (lubrication, tightening, cleaning)

---

## What We WILL Do (Light Maintenance)

### Category 1: Simple Replacements

- Replace light bulbs (standard bulbs, accessible fixtures)
- Replace batteries (smoke detectors, keypads, remotes)
- Replace filters (HVAC filters, if accessible and non-licensed)
- Replace door stops, door closers (simple adjustments)

**Requirements:**
- No electrical/plumbing work
- No licensed trade required
- Common-area only
- Worker trained in safe replacement

---

### Category 2: Minor Repairs

- Tighten loose screws (door handles, fixtures, handrails)
- Adjust door closers (simple adjustments)
- Lubricate hinges and locks
- Replace door handles (if same type, no wiring)
- Patch small holes in drywall (cosmetic, < 6 inches)

**Requirements:**
- No structural work
- No electrical/plumbing connections
- Common-area only
- Worker trained in safe repair

---

### Category 3: Preventive Maintenance

- Lubricate door hinges and locks
- Clean HVAC vents (accessible, non-licensed)
- Tighten loose fixtures
- Clean and adjust door closers
- Inspect and report issues (visual inspection only)

**Requirements:**
- No licensed trade work
- Common-area only
- Preventive only (not repairs)

---

### Category 4: Cleaning-Related Maintenance

- Clean and adjust door closers
- Clean and lubricate locks
- Clean HVAC vents (accessible)
- Remove debris from drains (if accessible, no plumbing work)

**Requirements:**
- Cleaning-related only
- No plumbing/electrical work
- Common-area only

---

## What We WILL NOT Do (Out of Scope)

### Category 1: Licensed Trades

- **Electrical:** No wiring, outlets, switches, panels, fixtures requiring license
- **Plumbing:** No pipe work, fixtures, water heaters, drains requiring license
- **HVAC:** No system repairs, refrigerant work, ductwork requiring license
- **Fire:** No fire system work, sprinklers, alarms requiring license
- **Elevator:** No elevator work (licensed trade only)

**Rule:** If a license is required, we do not perform the work. We coordinate third parties if requested.

---

### Category 2: Structural Work

- No wall repairs (beyond small cosmetic patches)
- No ceiling repairs
- No floor repairs (beyond cleaning)
- No door frame repairs (structural)
- No window repairs (beyond cleaning)

**Rule:** Structural work requires licensed contractors.

---

### Category 3: Unit Work

- No work inside resident units (even if "simple")
- No unit door repairs (unless common-area side only)
- No unit-related maintenance

**Rule:** Unit work is out of scope. Direct to property management.

---

### Category 4: Complex Repairs

- No appliance repairs
- No system diagnostics
- No troubleshooting beyond visual inspection
- No work requiring specialized tools or knowledge

**Rule:** If unsure, do not perform. Triage and escalate.

---

## Light Maintenance Workflow

### Step 1: Triage

**When maintenance issue discovered:**

**Step 1.1:** Assess issue:
- What is broken/damaged?
- Is it common-area?
- Is it light maintenance (per "will do" list)?
- Is licensed trade required?

**Step 1.2:** Decision tree:
- **Light maintenance (will do):** Proceed to Step 2
- **Licensed trade (won't do):** Escalate to Step 3
- **Unclear:** Escalate to Step 3

---

### Step 2: Light Maintenance Execution

**If light maintenance (will do):**

**Step 2.1:** Document issue:
- Create work order (type: Light Maintenance)
- Description: What needs repair
- Location: Specific area
- Status: REQUESTED

**Step 2.2:** Admin reviews:
- Verifies it's light maintenance
- Approves work order
- Assigns to worker (if applicable)
- Status: APPROVED → ASSIGNED

**Step 2.3:** Worker executes:
- Performs repair per scope
- Documents completion
- Takes before/after photos
- Status: COMPLETED

**Step 2.4:** Admin reviews:
- Verifies completion
- Marks INVOICED
- Client invoiced (if per-call pricing)

---

### Step 3: Licensed Trade Escalation

**If licensed trade required (won't do):**

**Step 3.1:** Document issue:
- Create work order (type: Licensed Trade Required)
- Description: What needs repair
- Location: Specific area
- Status: REQUESTED

**Step 3.2:** Admin coordinates:
- Contacts client/property management
- Arranges licensed contractor
- Work order status: ASSIGNED (to third party)

**Step 3.3:** Third party performs work:
- Licensed contractor executes
- Admin verifies completion
- Status: COMPLETED → INVOICED

**Step 3.4:** Client invoiced:
- If company coordinates, may include coordination fee
- Or client pays contractor directly

---

## Quoting Process

### When Quote Required

**Quote required if:**
- Work exceeds simple replacement/repair
- Materials needed (beyond standard supplies)
- Time estimate > 1 hour
- Per-call pricing applies

**Admin creates quote:**
- Description of work
- Materials needed
- Time estimate
- Price (per Schedule B or custom)

**Client approves quote:**
- Work order status: APPROVED
- Worker assigned
- Work proceeds

---

## Documentation Requirements

### Work Order Fields

**Required:**
- Type: Light Maintenance / Licensed Trade Required
- Description: What needs repair
- Location: Specific area
- Status: REQUESTED → APPROVED → ASSIGNED → COMPLETED → INVOICED → PAID
- Before photos: Condition before repair
- After photos: Condition after repair

**Optional:**
- Quote (if required)
- Materials used
- Time spent
- Notes

---

## Decision Tree: Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Light Bulb Burned Out
→ **Assess:** Standard bulb, accessible fixture? → **If yes, replace** → **If no (high ceiling, specialty fixture), escalate**

### Scenario: Door Closer Not Working
→ **Assess:** Simple adjustment or repair? → **If yes, adjust/repair** → **If no (needs replacement, licensed work), escalate**

### Scenario: Water Leak
→ **Assess:** Simple tightening or licensed plumbing? → **If licensed, STOP** → **Document incident** → **Escalate to licensed plumber**

### Scenario: Electrical Outlet Not Working
→ **STOP** → **Do not attempt repair** → **Document incident** → **Escalate to licensed electrician**

### Scenario: HVAC Not Working
→ **Assess:** Filter replacement (accessible) or system repair? → **If filter, replace** → **If system repair, escalate to licensed HVAC**

## Safety Considerations

**Before performing light maintenance:**

- [ ] Verify it's light maintenance (per "will do" list)
- [ ] Verify no licensed trade required
- [ ] Verify common-area only
- [ ] Verify worker trained for this task
- [ ] Verify safe to perform (no electrical/plumbing hazards)

**If any doubt:**
- **DO NOT** perform work
- Document issue
- Escalate to admin
- Admin coordinates licensed contractor if needed

## References

- Light maintenance scope: Schedule B (Add-On Menu) or separate light maintenance agreement
- Work order workflow: State machine (REQUESTED → APPROVED → ASSIGNED → COMPLETED → INVOICED → PAID)
- Incident reporting: SOP_04 (Issue Escalation and Incident Response)
- Health and safety: POL_02 (Health Safety and PPE)

---

**This SOP ensures clear boundaries for light maintenance. When in doubt, do not perform work. Escalate to admin for triage and coordination.**
