# BLVCKSHELL Facilities Services — Project Overview

**Status:** 🚧 In Development  
**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026

> **Vercel:** Use **one project** with **Root Directory** = **`portal`**. That single deployment serves the public site (/) and the workforce portal (/login, /admin, /jobs).

This repository contains three production-ready systems for BLVCKSHELL Facilities Services:

1. **[Operations Binder](./ops-binder/)** — Contracts, SOPs, policies, QA forms, checklists, state machines (47 markdown files)
2. **[Marketing Website](./marketing/)** — **Front-facing program**: public site (home, services, contact, lead capture, SEO). Visitors see this first; it must link to the portal.
3. **[Workforce Operations Portal](./portal/)** — Internal app (login, jobs, completions, admin); **accessible from the marketing site** via a “Portal” / “Log in” link.

## Execution Order

**Phase 0:** Pre-Flight (Decisions locked, repo structure)  
**Phase 1:** Operations Binder (47 markdown files)  
**Phase 2A:** Workforce Portal (Next.js + Supabase + Vercel)  
**Phase 2B:** Marketing Website (can run parallel to 2A after Phase 0)  
**Phase 3:** Final Validation (Production gate sign-off)

See **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** for complete step-by-step execution plan.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS
- Supabase account (for portal)
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Environment (single .env)

Portal and marketing **share one database** and **one env file** at repo root:

- Copy **`.env.example`** (in repo root) to **`.env`** at repo root and fill in values.
- Both apps read from **root `.env`** when running (portal and marketing load `../.env` automatically).
- On **Vercel**, set the same variables in each project (Portal project and Marketing project); use the same `DATABASE_URL` for both.

Do not create separate `.env` files in `portal/` or `marketing/` unless you need local overrides.

### Setup

1. **Review [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** — This is the execution blueprint
2. **Review [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md)** — All decisions are locked
3. **Follow Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2A → Phase 3** (P2B can parallel 2A)

Each component has its own README:
- `ops-binder/` — Operations Binder documentation
- `portal/` — Portal setup, env vars, deployment
- `marketing/` — Marketing site setup and deployment

**Deploying the portal (Vercel):** Set Vercel **Root Directory** to **`portal`** and add env vars. Full guide: **[portal/VERCEL.md](./portal/VERCEL.md)**.

## Quality Standards

All code follows gold standard practices:
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- Server-side RBAC on every route/action
- Input validation with Zod
- Error handling with clear messages
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Production gates satisfied before release

See **[ROADMAP.md Part 1](./ROADMAP.md#part-1-architecture--standards)** for complete coding standards.

---

## Production Readiness

The portal is production-ready only when:
- All production gates satisfied (see ROADMAP.md Part 4)
- Test suite passes (transitions, RBAC, upload validation, E2E)
- All documentation complete (README, DECISIONS, SECURITY, DATA_RETENTION, SEED)
- Smoke tests pass (all roles, all critical paths)

**NO dashboards or KPI visualization in Phase 1** — Metrics are collected but not visualized. See ROADMAP.md Part 8.

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for execution guidance
2. Check [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) for locked decisions
3. Review [EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./EXECUTION_PLAN.md) for phase details

**Next Step:** Begin Phase 0 (Pre-Flight) → Phase 1 (Operations Binder)
